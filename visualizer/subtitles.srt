00:00:00,666 --> 00:00:05,611
This is an explanation video for
an algorithm to play the board

2
00:00:05,635 --> 00:00:09,635
game "Codenames", written
by Michael and Asaf Kali.

3
00:00:09,659 --> 00:00:13,359
Part 1: The board game Codenames

4
00:00:13,384 --> 00:00:15,337
Let's first describe the game.

5
00:00:15,337 --> 00:00:21,871
In the game, two groups are competing eachother
- The blue team and the red team.

6
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:26,397
In each group there are two types
of players: The Spymaster on the right,

7
00:00:26,421 --> 00:00:31,061
and the field operatives on the left,
which are often played by multiple people.

8
00:00:31,927 --> 00:00:34,895
On the board there are
25 cards, each one with a

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,857
word witten on in.

10
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,837
Some cards represent blue agents,
and some represent red agents.

11
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:47,787
one represents a black Assassin, and the
others represent innocent gray Bystanders.

12
00:00:48,073 --> 00:00:52,373
but only the two Spymasters
hold the map that tells which

13
00:00:52,373 --> 00:00:54,210
card is assigned to which team.

14
00:00:54,797 --> 00:00:59,700
The goal of the Spymasters is to
have all the cards of their color exposed

15
00:01:00,377 --> 00:01:04,830
to do so, in each turn the Spymaster
chooses some of the cards of his color

16
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,103
to hint about.

17
00:01:06,117 --> 00:01:10,910
He then hints about them with a
single word, that somehow relates

18
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:14,690
to each of them, and adds the
number of cards he is hinting about.

19
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:19,867
Then, the field operatives guess which
cards did the Spymaster hint about.

20
00:01:19,867 --> 00:01:24,333
with each guess, The true color
of the card is being revealed.

21
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:28,350
Even when the Field
Operators guess a card from the

22
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,590
correct color, the Spymaster
may not give away if that

23
00:01:32,614 --> 00:01:35,514
was the card he hinted about or not.

24
00:01:35,826 --> 00:01:39,906
The Spymaster can try to
hint at many cards at once, but

25
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,643
if the Field Operators accidentally
choose a card from the

26
00:01:42,643 --> 00:01:46,083
opponent’s color or a
Bystander's gray card,

27
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:47,857
they loose their turn

28
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:54,150
If they hit the black Assassin’s
card - The team immediately looses.

29
00:01:54,174 --> 00:01:58,334
On the screen, the blue
guesser mistakes "costume" as

30
00:01:58,358 --> 00:02:02,678
a hint for "ninja", and the
blue team looses since

31
00:02:02,702 --> 00:02:04,702
"ninja" is the black Assassin.

32
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,416
Part 2: The Word2Vec Model

33
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:16,077
Our algorithm uses a
pre-trained Word2Vec model

34
00:02:16,117 --> 00:02:18,396
for it's linguistic knowledge.

35
00:02:18,417 --> 00:02:24,407
The Word2Vec model uses a big text
corpus such as Wikipedia or news sites

36
00:02:24,431 --> 00:02:29,631
to assign each word in the
vocabulary with an n-dimensional vector

37
00:02:29,655 --> 00:02:34,583
The vectors of the various words are
designed such that words that tend to

38
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:39,130
appear in the same context will
have small angle between them, while

39
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:44,010
distant, unrelated words will
have a larger angle between them.

40
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,854
Part 3: The Codenames Algorithm

41
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,079
Now we will describe
the algorithm itself.

42
00:02:53,143 --> 00:02:55,777
To see the problem from
the algorithm's perspective,

43
00:02:55,777 --> 00:02:58,663
We will visualize the cards
words as 3 dimensional

44
00:02:58,663 --> 00:03:00,663
unit vectors in a 3-d space.

45
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:05,711
In each turn, the first task
of the hinter is to find a

46
00:03:05,735 --> 00:03:08,730
proper subset of words
(usually two to four words)

47
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,330
on which he will hint.

48
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,794
Two methods of clustering
where implemented.

49
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:18,350
In the first clustering method, the
words are considered as nodes in a graph

50
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:22,830
with edges weights correlated
to their cosine similarity.

51
00:03:22,854 --> 00:03:29,174
This graph is divided into communities
using the Louvain SNA algorithm, and each

52
00:03:29,198 --> 00:03:34,318
community is taken as an optional
cluster of words to hint about in the next step.

53
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:40,190
The clusters are represented here
as groups of connected vectors.

54
00:03:40,213 --> 00:03:45,900
A second, "brute-force" method, simply
iterates over all combinations of words to

55
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,580
choose the best one.

56
00:03:50,177 --> 00:03:52,404
The second task of the hinter
is to choose a hinting word for

57
00:03:52,428 --> 00:03:56,087
each of the proposed clusters.

58
00:03:56,087 --> 00:04:02,407
In order to find a hinting word for a cluster,
the Spymaster (hinter) generates a "centroid"

59
00:04:02,431 --> 00:04:06,591
vector for the cluster, to
search real words near by.

60
00:04:07,277 --> 00:04:12,935
An initial "centroid" is proposed as the
Center of Mass of the cluster's vectors.

61
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:19,679
Ideally, the centroid would be close to all
the cluster's words and far from words of

62
00:04:19,703 --> 00:04:25,623
other colors. (where "close" and
"far" are considered in the angle metric.)

63
00:04:25,647 --> 00:04:34,170
To optimize the centroid, the nearby words in
the board (from  all colors) are considered

64
00:04:34,177 --> 00:04:38,071
as a physical system, where every
vector from the color of the hinter is an

65
00:04:38,095 --> 00:04:43,157
attractor, and every word
from other colors is a repeller.

66
00:04:44,263 --> 00:04:48,199
The centroid is then being pushed
and pulled by the words of the board

67
00:04:48,223 --> 00:04:53,983
until converging to a point where it
is both far away from bad words, and

68
00:04:54,007 --> 00:04:56,173
still close the cluster's words.

69
00:04:56,197 --> 00:05:01,957
The attraction force acts like a
spring, where if the centroid is too far,

70
00:05:01,981 --> 00:05:07,900
the spring can be "torn" apart and is no
longer considered as part of the cluster.

71
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:13,133
This is done in order to allow
outliers in the cluster to be thrown away.

72
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:17,883
After convergence, all there
needs to be done is to pick a word

73
00:05:17,883 --> 00:05:20,870
near-by the optimized
cluster's centroid.

74
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:25,590
The top n words with the lowest
cosine distance are examined

75
00:05:25,614 --> 00:05:28,800
and the best one is
chosen as the cluster's hint

76
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,920
The best hint from all clusters
is picked and being hinted to the

77
00:05:33,944 --> 00:05:36,528
Field Operators (the guessers).

78
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,670
Part 4: Examples

79
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:46,174
Here is an example of a well
hinted word by the algorithm.

80
00:05:46,863 --> 00:05:51,798
On the X-axis, lay the unrevealed
cards, when the Spymaster (hinter) gave the hint:

81
00:05:51,798 --> 00:05:54,990
"redevelopment, 2 cards".

82
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:59,454
On the Y-axis, you can see the
cosine distance between the hinted

83
00:05:59,454 --> 00:06:03,254
word "redevelopment" and the unrevealed cards.

84
00:06:04,223 --> 00:06:08,736
As can be seen, when the Field
Operators (guessers) search for the closest words

85
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:13,922
to "redevelopment", "park" and "skyscrapper"
are significantly closer then the

86
00:06:13,922 --> 00:06:18,831
other cards, and thus those
will be his two guesses.

87
00:06:18,855 --> 00:06:21,700
Here is another example
of a less successful hint

88
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:26,883
As can be seen, the red word
"earth" is semantically close to

89
00:06:26,908 --> 00:06:32,250
the hint "apollo", almost as
the desired blue word "moon"

90
00:06:32,637 --> 00:06:34,910
This might confuse the
guesser, and thus this hint will

91
00:06:35,091 --> 00:06:37,803
not be picked.

92
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,278
that's all -

93
00:06:40,302 --> 00:06:42,616
Thanks for wathing!
